FogFlow is an IoT edge computing framework that automatically orchestrates dynamic data processing flows over cloud and edges 
based on various **context**, including:

- *system context*: the available system resources from all layers;
- *data context*: the registered metadata of all available data entities; 
- *usage context*: the expected usage intention defined by users in terms QoS, latency, and bandwidth cost;
    
Thanks to its advanced intent-based programming model and context-driven service orchestration, 
FogFlow is able to **provide optimized QoS with minimal development effort and nearly zero operation overhead**. 
Currently, FogFlow has been applied into various business use cases in the areas of retails, smart cities, and smart industry.
